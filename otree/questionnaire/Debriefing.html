                                All the tweets you have seen are real. We just manipulated the brand name.
                                More precisely, we replaced the names of a real brand called <em>Zegna</em>  with <em>Estrava</em>.
                                Apart from that, all the information you have seen
                                (including the number of likes, retweets, etc.) was real.
