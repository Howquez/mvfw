# Freeriding the Metaverse

Using twitter data, we analyze the buzz sourrounding 2022's Metaverse Fashion Week (MVFW). We find that headlining fashion brands did not use the MVFW to reach the non attending audience. This stands in contrast to their social media efforts linked to physical fashion shows (Note to myself: need to systematically query data to show this). This leaves a vacuum other stakeholders are filling. More precisely, web3 evangelists free-ride the wave the MVFW triggers -- potentially reaching audiences they could not have reached otherwise.

## Background
Fast fashion is associated with waste, micro-plastics and a waste of resources. [Digital fashion](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81197117) promises to be superior to conventional (fast) fashion in all of these regards as it allows consumers, for instance, to 
try on outfits virtually such that they can better assess the clothing even before its physical twins have been shipped. Another scenario is that it reduces the consumption of physical fashion since the virtual fashions suffice as a means to represent oneself in social media or the _metaverse_.

Along these lines several different stakeholders (including major brands such as [Forever21](https://twitter.com/Forever21/status/1507729045823234056) and [Tommy Hilfiger](https://twitter.com/TommyHilfiger/status/1507025541945245708)) started to experiment at the intersection of non fungible tokens (NFTs) and fashion organizing the first ever _Metaverse Fashion Week_ (MVFW) online in March 2022. In addition, the 2022's New York Fashion Week is also accompanied by the [release of NFTs that match physical fashions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/yolarobert1/2022/09/10/alo-yoga-debuts-its-first-ready-to-wear-collection-with-a-limited-edition-nft-at-new-york-fashion-week/).

Due to this recency, we scrape twitter data to better understand the key stakeholders of the MVFW.
